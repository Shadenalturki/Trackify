## Overview:
Trackify is an application that helps students and users manage their college assignments and project deadlines efficiently.
It allows users to log in, track project progress, sort projects, mark them as completed, and even receive automated email reminders before deadlines.

- As a user, I should be able to:
- Log in securely using my username and password.
- View all my "In Progress" and "Completed" projects.
- Add new projects with fields like project name, subject, marks, deadline, and description.
- Edit existing project details if needed.
- Sort projects by marks (high/low) or by deadlines (nearest/furthest).
- Mark projects as completed when finished.
- Delete completed projects from the list.
- Receive email reminders two days before any project deadline.
- Log out securely after managing my tasks.
